# Logistic Regression

This repository contains code and documentation for implementing and understanding logistic regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for binary classification tasks.

## Introduction
Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). The goal of logistic regression is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between the dependent variable and a set of independent variables.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd logistic-regression
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset. Ensure it is in a CSV format and properly cleaned.
2. Load and preprocess the data using the provided scripts.
3. Train the logistic regression model.
4. Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
Include a section where you present the results of your model. You can include:
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- ROC curve and AUC
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Feel free to adjust this template based on your project's specifics and requirements.
